# Compact C# Data
A C# serialization/deserialization module, with support for all built-in C# types and all built-in Unity and Godot structs.

The module uses a custom serialization format, called Compact C# Data (CSCD). It's designed to be compact, general and relatively easy to parse, while having a relatively readable syntax.
